## Learning is Misunderstood
learning is an acquired skill, most effective strategies are often counter-intuitive 反直觉的

> Learning is deeper and stronger when it's effortfull.

least productive: rereading text, massed practice (Easy but weak, last short)
#### Best Learning Techniques:
Key:
1. **Retrieval Practice**
Retrieval practice is to recall knowledge from memory (includes quizzing, self-testing). It is the best thing to do for learning.
2. **Spaced practice**
3. **Interleaved practice**

Tips:
- Connection between knowledge
- Trying to solve a problem before being taught
- Distilling the underlying principles

要点：retrieval, spacing, interleaving, variation, Reflection, and elaboration.

## Reflection
Reflection is a form of retrieval practice
(What happened? What did I do? How did it work out?)

**Reflection involves**：
- Retrieval Practice (recalling recently learned knowledge to mind),
- Elaboration (for example, connecting new knowledge to what you already know)
- Generation (for example, rephrasing key ideas in your own words or visualizing and mentally rehearsing what you might do differently next date).
