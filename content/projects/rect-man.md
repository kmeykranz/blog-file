• Built a real time multiplayer system with TCP synchronization. 
• Designed a pseudo 3D world with dynamic camera tracking and AI zombies.  

I made this game when I was in grade 10. It’s one of the games I developed without using a game engine. After learning about the tcp functions in Qt. I used them to make this game for practicing.
